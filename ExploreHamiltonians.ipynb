        "Hamiltonian mechanics is a branch of physics concerned with conservation laws and invariances. There is considerable interest in using deep neural networks to model dynamical systems, whether for system identification or long-term prediction purposes. Existing neural networks that are used to model dynamical systems, irrespective of whether they predict states in discrete timesteps or in a continuous fashion, do not learn exact conservation laws or invariant quantities - to quote one of the papers below, they may drift away from the true dynamics of the system as small errors accumulate. The methods we will see next, namely:\n",
